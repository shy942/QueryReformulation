Bug localization is one of the most challending tasks undertaken by the developers during software maintenance.
Existing studies mostly rely on lexical similarity between the bug reports and source code for bug localization.
However, such similarity always does not exist, and these studies suffer from vocabulary mismatch issues.
In this paper, we propose a bug localization technique that (1) not only uses lexical similarity between bug report and source code documents  
but also (2) exploits the co-occurrences between keywords from the past reports and source tokens from corresponding changed code. 
Experiments using a collection of ~6000 bug reports show that our technique performs significantly higher in terms of Hit@K and MAP 
than two IR-based bug localization techniques using TF-IDF and LDA.
